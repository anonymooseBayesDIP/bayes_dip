## bayes_dip

`bayes_dip` implements the Linearised Deep Image Prior, a framework for estimating uncertainty of DIP reconstructions.

The method and experiments on Computer Tomography data are described in the paper "Uncertainty Estimation for Computed Tomography with a Linearised Deep Image Prior".

The implementation uses the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework.
